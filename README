This ITK module provides the capabilities to efficiently compute
oriented bounding around a labels in a label image and extract images
for the bounding boxes.

Additionally, this module provide a LabelShapeStatistics filter which
proved an interface simular the the ITK's LabelStatistics filter, but
for shape attributes. This is Simular to the LabepGeometry filter
currently in ITK review, but is internally based on the LabelMap
framework for more efficient computation and support for spacing and
image orientation.


General
------

This is a module for ITK: The Insight Toolkit for Segmentation and
Registration. It is designed to work with the ITKv4 modular system and
to be places it ITK/Modules/External.

Getting Started
---------------
