This ITK module provides the capabilities to efficiently compute
oriented bounding around a labels in a label image and extract images
for the bounding boxes.

Additionally, this module provide a LabelShapeStatistics filter which
proved an interface simular the the ITK's LabelStatistics filter, but
for shape attributes. This is Simular to the LabelGeometry filter
currently in ITK review, but is internally based on the LabelMap
framework for more efficient computation and support for spacing and
image orientation.


General
------

This is a module for ITK: The Insight Toolkit for Segmentation and
Registration. It is designed to work with the ITKv4 modular system and
to be placed in ITK/Modules/External.


Getting Started
---------------

This module should be cloned into the ITK reposiory as a subdirectory in the "Modules/External" directory.

The following is a brief list of instructions to get a external module into ITK:

cd ITK/Modules/External/
git clone https://github.com/blowekamp/itkOBBLabelMap.git

Then configure ITK as not make but set "Module_OBBLabelMap" to "ON" to
enable this module. The external module will need to be manually
updated from the git respository.
